# Rails Generators

We came up with convinient Rails generators to create new engines and local gems.
You can use them as an example (they are too opinionated for general use).

Copy the contents of the `generators/` folder to you `lib/generators` to add them to your app.
That would add two generators:

- `rails g engine <name>`
- `rails g gem <name>`.
